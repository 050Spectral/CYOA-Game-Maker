# CYOA-Game-Maker
Optimized method of creating a cyoa game that doesn't require a hundred if statements. The program scales with how many options are included. Basically twine but shittier

- To get this to work, go to cyoaSenarios.py and create a new class to represent a new screen.
- In cyoaGame.py, update the dictionary with both the string and object version of the new class
- It should update itself from there.

Note to self: Figure out a actual interface
